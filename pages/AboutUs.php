    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p class="start">
        Hey gamers! Welcome to ByteRage, where our passion for gaming fuels our drive to innovate.
        It all began when our professor presented us with a Case Study: Create a Transaction-based
        System for purchasing items. As Computer Science students who are also passionate about gaming,
        We all felt the same frustration when our peripherals frequently failed to work properly.
        This made us think about how we could improve gaming peripherals and, more importantly, how we
        could assist fellow gamers in accessing top-quality peripherals at affordable prices. And that's how ByteRage started.
        <br>
    </p>
    <p class="start">
        <br> We named our business ByteRage because it combines 'byte,' is a unit most computers use to represent
        a characters, with 'rage,' showing our intense passion for gaming. A perfect example of this is our leader
        Eron B he gets easily frustrated whenever we play online games due to his skill
        issues and he often gets tilted and rage quits after repeatedly dying in the game.
        The team also chose "rage" because sometimes when we talk, it sounds like we're arguing, but we're
        not. That's just how we communicate - loudly! It's a sign of our passion and strong bond as a team.
        But don't worry, we're not here to make you mad. We're here to make gaming fun! So whether you need
        a new mouse, a better keyboard, or just some tips on how to improve your gaming setup, you're in the
        right place. And we're here to assist you every step of the way.
    </p>

    <p class="start">
        <br>
        Our goal is simple: to enhance gaming experiences. We're on a mission to help you discover the best
        gaming gear out there, allowing you to focus on what you love most: playing games. We understand that
        every gamer is unique, with different preferences, playstyles, and budgets. That's why we're dedicated
        to offering a diverse range of gaming peripherals to cater to all kinds of gamers. Whether you're a
        casual gamer seeking affordable options, a competitive player in search of high-performance gear, or
        somewhere in between, we've got you covered.
