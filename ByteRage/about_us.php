    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p class="start">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, Welcome to ByteRage, We're a bunch of Computer Science students who love playing games.
        We know how frustrating it is when your gaming gear isn't up to scratch. Whether it's a laggy mouse, a glitchy keyboard,
        or a headset that just won't stay connected, we've been there. And we're here to help.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="start">
        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We chose the name ByteRage because it's a combination of "byte" (computer stuff) and "rage" because Eron,
        our leader, sometimes gets mad when we play games due to his skill issues,
        and he's known for his occasional rage quits and getting easily tilted. The team also chose "rage" because
        sometimes when we talk, it sounds like we're arguing, but we're not. That's just how we communicate - loudly!
        It's a sign of our passion and strong bond as a team. But don't worry, we're not here to make you mad. We're here to make gaming fun!
        So whether you need a new mouse, a better keyboard, or just some tips on how to improve your gaming setup, you're in the right place.
    </p>
    <p class="start">
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal is simple: to make gaming better. We're on a mission to help you find the best gaming gear out there, so you can focus on what you love most: playing games. We understand that every gamer is unique, with different preferences, playstyles, and budgets. That's why we're committed to providing a diverse range of gaming peripherals to suit all kinds of gamers. Whether you're a casual gamer looking for affordable options, a competitive player seeking high-performance gear, or somewhere in between, we've got you covered. But ByteRage is more than just a place to buy gaming gear. It's a community where gamers can come together to share their passion, exchange tips and tricks, and connect with like-minded individuals. We're here to support you on your gaming journey, whether you're a seasoned veteran or just starting out.
    </p>
    <p class="start">
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for choosing ByteRage. We're excited to embark on this gaming journey with you! Happy Gaming!<br>
